They try to \"work their magic\" by performing <i>pseudo</i> \"supernatural\" stunts, weaving <i>illusions</i> about the Christian life to use \"powerful\" religious formulas (\"incantations\") that manipulate the Lord into granting more temporal gifts (especially \"invincible health and wealth\").  This has a \"drugging\" effect on the aspiring religious zealot, inducing them to think they have \"special spiritual powers\" (that do <i>not</i> operate in keeping with Scripture).  <a href=\"/greek/5331.htm\">See 5331</a> (<i>pharmakeía</i>).</p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"85\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"/discovery.htm\" frameborder=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"></iframe><div class=\"vheading2\">NAS Exhaustive Concordance</div><span class=\"hdg\">Word Origin</span>","us":""}
